            <a>A11y Lab</a>, a research unit within Penn State's College of
            Information Science and Technology (IST), specializes in
            Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) with a focus on Accessible
            Computing. Its mission is to understand and enhance technology's
            interaction with human abilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through innovative methodologies such as human-AI teaming and
            inclusive design, it develops intelligent technologies catering to
            diverse needs. The lab pioneers solutions fostering inclusivity and
            accessibility, creating opportunities for individuals from all
            backgrounds.

            This course teaches the basics of computer programming and
            computational thinking, including core concepts like loops,
            conditions, functions, and data types.
          </p>
          <p>
            Students will learn to solve problems by breaking them down into
            smaller parts, implementing solutions step by step, and evaluating
            their effectiveness. The emphasis is on understanding
            problem-solving techniques, abstraction, and evaluating code for
            correctness and efficiency.
          </p>
          <p>
            By the end, students will be skilled in designing and analyzing
            computational solutions across various levels of abstraction, using
            imperative programming principles.

            AERSP 424 Advanced Computer Programming is a course focusing on
            advanced programming techniques using Java, C++, and Ada95,
            alongside current operating systems like Linux and Unix, and
            compilers such as gcc. It emphasizes Object-Oriented Programming
            (OOP), comparing and contrasting OOP with functional and procedural
            programming, and explores the differences and similarities among
            Java, C++, and Ada95.
          </p>
          <p>
            The course includes hands-on programming exercises and serves as a
            core course for the Graduate Minor in High Performance Computing, as
            well as a technical elective in Aerospace Engineering.
